# Maven

Maven is a popular build automation and project management tool for Java-based projects. It simplifies managing dependencies, compiling code, running tests, and packaging applications. Here are some of its main features:

**Dependency Management**: Maven automatically handles the libraries or dependencies needed for a project, downloading them from a central repository (like Maven Central) and managing their versions and compatibility.

**Build Automation**: It provides a standardized way to compile code, run tests, and create executable JAR or WAR files, making builds consistent across environments.

**Project Structure**: Maven promotes a standardized project structure, which includes folders for source code, test code, and resources. This consistency makes it easier to manage projects in teams.

**Plugins**: It supports a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality, allowing for code analysis, reporting, and integration with other tools.

**Project Object Model (POM)**: The core of a Maven project is the pom.xml file, where configurations, dependencies, and plugins are defined. It serves as the blueprint of the project, simplifying builds and deployments.

Maven is widely used in development pipelines, especially in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) setups, because it standardizes and streamlines building and deploying Java applications.
