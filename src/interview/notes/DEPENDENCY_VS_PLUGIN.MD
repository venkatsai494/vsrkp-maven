In Maven, plugins and dependencies serve different purposes, though they both help in building and managing a project:

1.  **Maven Dependency**:

    *   A dependency in Maven is a library (usually a `.jar` file) that the project requires to compile, test, or run. These dependencies are specified in the `<dependencies>` section of the `pom.xml`.
    *   Maven downloads the dependencies automatically from the specified repository and includes them in the project’s classpath.
    *   Example: If you need a logging library, you might add it as a dependency so it’s available during both compile-time and runtime.

    ```xml
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
            <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
            <version>1.7.30</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```

2.  **Maven Plugin**:

    *   A plugin in Maven is a tool that executes specific tasks during the build process. Plugins handle various build phases, such as compiling code, running tests, packaging, etc. They are defined in the `<build><plugins>` section of the `pom.xml`.
    *   Maven plugins are executed at different stages of the Maven build lifecycle. For example, the `maven-compiler-plugin` is used to compile source code, while the `maven-surefire-plugin` is used to run tests.
    *   Example: If you want to compile your Java code with specific options, you would configure the `maven-compiler-plugin`.

    ```xml
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.8.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <source>1.8</source>
                    <target>1.8</target>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
    ```


In summary:

*   **Dependencies** bring in external libraries needed to run or compile the project.
*   **Plugins** add functionality to perform specific tasks in the build lifecycle, such as compiling or testing.
